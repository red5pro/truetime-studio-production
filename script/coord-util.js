/**
 * Utility method to get the actualized bounding box coordinates for the visible area of a video element.
 * This will return the x, y, width and height of the visible area of the video element based on the size
 *  of the element and the assigned `object-fit` style.
 * The following `object-fit` values are supported:
 * - contain
 * - cover
 * - none / unassigned
 *
 * @param {Number} viewWidth The width dimension of the video itself.
 * @param {Number} viewHeight The height dimension of the video itself.
 * @param {Number} clientWidth The width of the video element on the DOM.
 * @param {Number} clientHeight The height of the video element on the DOM.
 * @param {String} objectFit The `object-fit` style assigned to the video element.
 * @returns
